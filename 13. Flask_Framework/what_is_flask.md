### What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight WSGI (web server gateway interface) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

### What is WSGI?

WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web application. It allows web servers to communicate with web applications written in Python. WSGI is a Python standard described in detail in PEP 3333.
    

### What is a web server?

A web server is a software application that serves web pages to clients over the HTTP protocol. The web server listens for incoming requests from clients and sends back the requested resources, such as HTML pages, images, or other files.
    

### What is a web application?

A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed by clients over the internet. Web applications can be simple, such as a single web page, or complex, such as a social media platform or online shopping site.

### What is Werkzeug?

Werkzeug is a WSGI utility library for Python. It provides low-level utilities for handling HTTP requests and responses, as well as higher-level abstractions for routing, debugging, and other web application tasks. Flask is built on top of Werkzeug and uses its features to handle HTTP requests and responses.
    
### What is Jinja 2?

Jinja 2 is a template engine for Python. It allows developers to create dynamic HTML content by embedding Python code within HTML templates. Jinja 2 is used by Flask to render HTML templates and generate dynamic web pages.
    
### example use case of Flask

to build a simple web application that displays a list of products and allows users to add new products to the list. The application will have two routes: one to display the list of products and another to add a new product. The data will be stored in an SQLite database.

    "## Introduction to Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers. These deep neural networks enable systems to learn hierarchical patterns and representations directly from raw data.\n",

    "- Automation of feature extraction\n",
    "- Scalability with massive datasets\n",
    "- High performance on complex tasks (e.g., image and speech recognition)\n",

    "## How Deep Learning Works\n",
    "---\n",
    "Deep learning models are based on **artificial neural networks**. Hereâ€™s how they work step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Accepts input data (e.g., images, text, or numerical data).\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations to extract features. The number of hidden layers defines the model's depth.\n",
    "3. **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that are adjusted during training to minimize error.\n",
    "4. **Activation Functions**: Add non-linearity to the model (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).\n",
    "5. **Backpropagation**: A technique to update weights using the gradient of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematics Behind a Single Neuron:**\n",
    "The output of a single neuron can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = f(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b) $$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $x_i$ = Inputs\n",
    "- $w_i$ = Weights\n",
    "- $b$ = Bias\n",
    "- $f$ = Activation function\n"

    "### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n",
    "- Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series, text).\n",
    "- Maintains a memory of past inputs through feedback loops.\n",

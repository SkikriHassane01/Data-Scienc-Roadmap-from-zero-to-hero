2. **Data Handling**
   - Working with CSV, JSON, and XML files
   - Text file parsing
3. **Basic NLP Tasks**
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

---

## Phase 2: Statistical NLP and Classical Techniques
1. **Feature Engineering for Text**
   - One-hot encoding
   - N-grams
   - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
2. **Basic NLP Applications**
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA)
   - Text Classification (using Scikit-learn)
3. **Language Models**
   - Basics of n-gram models
   - Perplexity and its use

---

## Phase 3: Deep Learning for NLP
1. **Neural Networks Basics**
   - Fully Connected Networks
   - Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax)
2. **Sequence Models**
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   - Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
3. **Modern NLP Architectures**
   - Attention Mechanism
   - Transformers
   - BERT, GPT (overview and applications)

---

## Phase 4: Advanced NLP Techniques
1. **Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models**
   - Hugging Face library
   - Transformers for various NLP tasks
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
3. **Question Answering Systems**
4. **Text Generation**
   - Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT models)
5. **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech**
   - Libraries like SpeechRecognition, Google Text-to-Speech
6. **Summarization Techniques**
   - Extractive vs Abstractive Summarization

---

## Phase 5: NLP Deployment and Scaling
1. **Model Deployment**
   - Using Flask/Django for API integration
